# Source Code Control Events

Source Code Control events includes the subjects and predicates related to changes in Source Code repositories that are relevant from a Continuous Delivery perspective.

## Subjects

This specification defines two subjects in this stage: `repository` and `change`. Events associated with these subjects are triggered by actions performed by software developers or bots that provide useful automation for software developers.

| Subject | Description | Predicates |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| [`repository`](#repository) | A software configuration management (SCM)repository | [`created`](#repository-created), [`modified`](#repository-modified), [`deleted`](#repository-deleted)|
| [`branch`](#branch) | A branch in a software configuration management (SCM)repository | [`created`](#branch-created), [`deleted`](#branch-deleted)|
| [`change`](#change) | A change proposed to the content of a *repository* | [`created`](#change-created), [`reviewed`](#change-reviewed), [`merged`](#change-merged), [`abandoned`](#change-abandoned), [`updated`](#change-updated)|

Each `repository` can emit events related with proposed source code `changes`. Each `change` can include a single or multiple commits that can also be tracked.

### `repository`

An SCM `repository` is identified by a `name`, an `owner` which can be a user or an organization, a `url` which is where the `repository` is hosted and optionally a `viewUrl`, which is a web location for humans to browse the content of the `repository`.

| Field | Type | Description | Examples |
|-------|------|-------------|----------|
| id    | `String` | Uniquely identifies the subject within the source. | `an-org/a-repo`, `an-user/a-repo` |
| source | `URI-Reference` | [source](../spec.md#source) from the context | `my-git.example`|
| name  | `String` | The name of the `repository` | `spec`, `community`, `a-repo` |
| owner | `String` | The owner of the `repository` | `cdevents`, `an-org`, `an-user`|
| url | `URI` | URL to the `repository` for API operations. This URL needs to include the protocol used to connect to the repository. | `git://my-git.example/an-org/a-repo` |
| viewUrl | `URI` | URL for humans to view the content of the `repository`  | `https://my-git.example/an-org/a-repo/view`|

### `branch`

A `branch` in an SCM repository is identified by its `id`.

| Field | Type | Description | Examples |
|-------|------|-------------|----------|
| id    | `String` | Uniquely identifies the subject within the source. | `main`, `feature-a`, `fix-issue-1` |
| source | `URI-Reference` | [source](../spec.md#source) from the context | `my-git.example`|
| repository | `Object` | A reference to the repository where the change event happened | `{"id": "an-org/a-repo"}` |

### `change`

A `change` identifies a proposed set of changes to the content of a `repository`. The usual lifecycle of a `change` The data model for `changes` is not defined yet.

| Field | Type | Description | Examples |
|-------|------|-------------|----------|
| id    | `String` | Uniquely identifies the subject within the source. | `1234`, `featureBranch123` |
| source | `URI-Reference` | [source](../spec.md#source) from the context | `my-git.example`|
| repository | `Object` ([`repository`](#repository)) | A reference to the repository where the change event happened | `{"id": "an-org/a-repo"}` |
