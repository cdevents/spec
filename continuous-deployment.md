# Continuous Deployment Events

Continuous Deployment (CD) events are related to continuous deployment pipelines and their target environments. These events can be emitted by environments to report where software artifacts such as services, binaries, daemons, jobs or embedded software are running.

## Subjects

This specification defines two subjects in this stage: `environment` and `service`. The term `service` is used to represent a running Artifact. A `service` can represent a binary that is running, a daemon, an application, a docker container. The term `environment` represent any platform which has all the means to run a `service`.

| Subject | Description | Predicates |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| [`environment`](#environment) | An environment where to run services | [`created`](#environment-created), [`modified`](#environment-modified), [`deleted`](#environment-deleted)|
| [`service`](#service) | A service | [`deployed`](#service-deployed), [`upgraded`](#service-upgraded), [`rolledback`](#service-rolledback), [`removed`](#service-removed), [`published`](#service-published)|

### `environment`

An `environment` is a platform which may run a `service`.

| Field | Type | Description | Examples |

| type | `String` | See [type](spec.md#type-subject) | `environment` |
| name | `String` | Name of the environment | `dev`, `staging`, `production`, `ci-123`|
| url | `String` | URL to reference where the environment is located | `https://my-cluster.zone.my-cloud-provider`|

### `service`

A `service` can represent for example a binary that is running, a daemon, an application or a docker container.
