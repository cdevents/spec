# Continuous Operations Events

Continuous Operations events are related to the operation of services deployed in target environments.

## Subjects

This specification defines two subjects in this stage: [`incident`](#incident) and [`ticket`](#ticket). Events associated to these subjects can be generated by a number of different actors, such as the end-user, an SRE, a quality gate, a monitoring system, or the service itself.

| Subject | Description | Predicates |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| [`incident`](#incident) | A problem in a production environment | [`detected`](#incident-detected), [`reported`](#incident-reported), [`resolved`](#incident-resolved) |
| [`ticket`](#ticket) | A ticket in a ticketing system | [`created`](#ticket-created), [`updated`](#ticket-updated), [`closed`](#ticket-closed) |

### `incident`

An `incident` represents a problem in a production environment. To quote the definition of the term from the NIST glossary, an [incident][] is:

> An occurrence that actually or potentially jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an information system or the information the system processes, stores, or transmits or that constitutes a violation or imminent threat of violation of security policies, security procedures, or acceptable use policies.
