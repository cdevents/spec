# Continuous Integration Events

Continuous Integration (CI) events include the subject and predicates related to CI activities such as building software, producing artifacts and running tests.

## Subjects

This specification defines three subjects in this stage: `builds`, `artifacts` and `tests`. Events associated with these subjects are typically generated either by a CI system that orchestrates the process or by a specific build or test tool directly. Some artifact events may be generated by the system that stores the artifact as well.

| Subject | Description | Predicates |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| [`build`](#build) | A software build | [`queued`](#build-queued), [`started`](#build-started), [`finished`](#build-finished)|
| [`testCase`](#testcase) | A software test case | [`queued`](#testcase-queued), [`started`](#testcase-started), [`finished`](#testcase-finished)|
| [`testSuite`](#testsuite) | A collection of test cases | [`started`](#testsuite-started), [`finished`](#testsuite-finished)|
| [`artifact`](#artifact) | An artifact produced by a build | [`packaged`](#artifact-packaged), [`published`](#artifact-published)|

### `build`

A `build` is a process that uses a recipe to produce an artifact from source code.

__Note:__ The data model for `builds`, apart from `id` and `source`, only includes the identifier of the artifact produced by the build. The inputs to the build process are not specified yet.

| Field | Type | Description | Examples |
|-------|------|-------------|----------|
| id    | `String` | Uniquely identifies the subject within the source. | `1234`, `maven123`, `builds/taskrun123` |
| source | `URI-Reference` | [source](/spec.md#source-context) from the context | `staging/tekton`, `tekton-dev-123`|
| artifactId | `String` | Identifier of the artifact produced by the build | `pkg:oci/myapp@sha256%3A0b31b1c02ff458ad9b7b81cbdf8f028bd54699fa151f221d1e8de6817db93427`, `pkg:golang/mygit.com/myorg/myapp@234fd47e07d1004f0aed9c` |

### `testCase`

A `testCase` is a process that performs a test against an input software artifact of some kind, for instance source code, a binary, a container image or else. A `testCase`  is the smallest unit of testing that the user wants to track. `testCases` are executed, and `testSuites` are for grouping purposes. For this reason, `testCases` can be queued.

__Note:__ The data model for `testCase` only includes `id` and `source`, inputs and outputs of the process are not specified yet, as well as the relation to `testSuite`.

| Field | Type | Description | Examples |
|-------|------|-------------|----------|
| id    | `String` | Uniquely identifies the subject within the source. | `unitest-abc`, `e2e-test1`, `scan-image1` |
| source | `URI-Reference` | [source](/spec.md#source-context) from the context | `staging/tekton`, `tekton-dev-123`|

### `testSuite`

A `testSuite` represents a set of one or more `testCases`.

__Note:__ The data model for `testSuite` only includes `id` and `source`, inputs and outputs of the process are not specified yet, as well as the relation to `testCase`.

| Field | Type | Description | Examples |
|-------|------|-------------|----------|
| id    | `String` | Uniquely identifies the subject within the source. | `unit`, `e2e`, `security` |
| source | `URI-Reference` | [source](/spec.md#source-context) from the context | `staging/tekton`, `tekton-dev-123`|

### `artifact`

An `artifact` is usually produced as output of a build process. Events need to be generated to indicate that an `artifact` has been packaged and released for others to use. These events can be produced by the artifact producer or by the artifact storage system.

| Field | Type | Description | Examples |
|-------|------|-------------|----------|
| id    | `String` | Uniquely identifies the subject within the source. | `pkg:oci/myapp@sha256%3A0b31b1c02ff458ad9b7b81cbdf8f028bd54699fa151f221d1e8de6817db93427`, `pkg:golang/mygit.com/myorg/myapp@234fd47e07d1004f0aed9c` |
| source | `URI-Reference` | [source](/spec.md#source-context) from the context | `staging/tekton`, `tekton-dev-123`|
| change | `object`        | The change (tag, commit, revision) of the repository which was used to build the artifact" | `{"id": "527d4a1aca5e8d0df24813df5ad65d049fc8d312", "source": "my-git.example/an-org/a-repo"}`, `{"id": "feature1234", "source": "my-git.example/an-org/a-repo"}` |
