# Continuous Integration Events

Continuous Integration (CI) events include the subject and predicates related to CI activities such as building software, producing artifacts and running tests.

## Subjects

This specification defines three subjects in this stage: `builds`, `artifacts` and `tests`. Events associated with these subjects are typically generated either by a CI system that orchestrates the process or by a specific build or test tool directly. Some artifact events may be generated by the system that stores the artifact as well.

| Subject | Description | Predicates |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| [`build`](#build) | A software build | [`queued`](#build-queued), [`started`](#build-started), [`finished`](#build-finished)|
| [`artifact`](#artifact) | An artifact produced by a build | [`packaged`](#artifact-packaged), [`published`](#artifact-published)|

> `testCase`/`testSuite` events have moved to their own top-level bucket [Testing Events](testing-events.md)

### `build`

A `build` is a process that uses a recipe to produce an artifact from source code.

__Note:__ The data model for `builds`, apart from `id` and `source`, only includes the identifier of the artifact produced by the build. The inputs to the build process are not specified yet.

| Field | Type | Description | Examples |
|-------|------|-------------|----------|
| id    | `String` | Uniquely identifies the subject within the source. | `1234`, `maven123`, `builds/taskrun123` |
| source | `URI-Reference` | [source](../spec.md#source) from the context | `staging/tekton`, `tekton-dev-123`|
| type | `String` | See [type](spec.md#type-subject) | `build` |
| artifactId | `String` | Identifier of the artifact produced by the build | `pkg:oci/myapp@sha256%3A0b31b1c02ff458ad9b7b81cbdf8f028bd54699fa151f221d1e8de6817db93427`, `pkg:golang/mygit.com/myorg/myapp@234fd47e07d1004f0aed9c` |

### `artifact`

An `artifact` is usually produced as output of a build process. Events need to be generated to indicate that an `artifact` has been packaged and released for others to use. These events can be produced by the artifact producer or by the artifact storage system.

| Field | Type | Description | Examples |
|-------|------|-------------|----------|
| id    | `String` | See [id](spec.md#id-subject)| `pkg:oci/myapp@sha256%3A0b31b1c02ff458ad9b7b81cbdf8f028bd54699fa151f221d1e8de6817db93427`, `pkg:golang/mygit.com/myorg/myapp@234fd47e07d1004f0aed9c` |
| source | `URI-Reference` | See [source](spec.md#source-subject) | `staging/tekton`, `tekton-dev-123`|
| type | `String` | See [type](spec.md#type-subject) | `artifact` |
| change | `object`        | The change (tag, commit, revision) of the repository which was used to build the artifact" | `{"id": "527d4a1aca5e8d0df24813df5ad65d049fc8d312", "source": "my-git.example/an-org/a-repo"}`, `{"id": "feature1234", "source": "my-git.example/an-org/a-repo"}` |

## Events

### `build queued`

This event represents a Build task that has been queued; this build process usually is in charge of producing a binary from source code.

- Event Type: __`dev.cdevents.build.queued.0.1.1`__
- Predicate: queued
- Subject: [`build`](#build)

| Field | Type | Description | Examples | Required |
|-------|------|-------------|----------|----------------------------|
| id    | `String` | See [id](spec.md#id-subject)| `1234`, `maven123`, `builds/taskrun123` | ✅ |
| source | `URI-Reference` | See [source](spec.md#source-subject) | | |
| type | `String` | See [type](spec.md#type-subject) | `build` | |

### `build started`

This event represents a Build task that has been started; this build process usually is in charge of producing a binary from source code.

- Event Type: __`dev.cdevents.build.started.0.1.1`__

### `artifact packaged`

The event represents an artifact that has been packaged for distribution; this artifact is now versioned with a fixed version.
