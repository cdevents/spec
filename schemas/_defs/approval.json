  "term": "Approval",
  "definition": "A formal decision point in a pipeline or workflow where an identifiable entitym, human or automated, makes an accountable authorization decision that determines whether execution continues. Unlike an evaluation, an approval requires a responder whose decision could have gone differently and can be attributed and audited. An approval has a lifecycle: it is created, may receive one or more non-terminal decisions, and is eventually resolved into a terminal state.",
  "notes": [
    "An approval is distinct from the resource it gates, and references the resource via resourceTargetUrl but does not describe it. Use the appropriate event type for the resource itself.",
    "A single approval may receive multiple decisions before reaching a terminal state, supporting both human approver flows and automated policy engines.",
    "The responder may be a human identity, an automated system, or any external entity capable of authorizing progression."
  ],
  "examples": [
    "A deployment gate requiring human sign-off before a production rollout proceeds",
    "An automated policy engine authorizing a pipeline to continue after a compliance check",
    "A regulated change management gate requiring auditable authorization before a release",
    "A maintenance window system authorizing a deployment to proceed when the window opens",
    "An external compliance system that must approve before a sensitive operation executes"
  ],
  "counterExamples": [
    "A unit test suite asserting code correctness before a build proceeds",
    "An automated linter check that blocks a pull request",
    "A readiness probe or health check that gates a rollout",
    "A budget threshold check that must be satisfied before a resource is provisioned"
