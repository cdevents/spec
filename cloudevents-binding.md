# CloudEvents Binding for CDEvents

## Abstract

The CloudEvents Binding for CDEvents defines how CDEvents are mapped to CloudEvents headers and body.

## CloudEvents Context

The CloudEvents context is built by the event producer using some of the data
from the [CDEvents context](spec.md#context).

### specversion

The [CloudEvents `specversion`][ce-version] MUST be set to `1.0`.

### id

The [CloudEvents `id`][ce-id] MUST be set to the CDEvents [`id`](spec.md#id).

### source

The [CloudEvents `source`][ce-source] MUST be set to the CDEvents [`source`](spec.md#source).

### type

The [CloudEvents `type`][ce-type] MUST be set to the [`type`](spec.md#type) of the CDEvent.

### subject

The [CloudEvents `subject`][ce-subject] MUST be set to the [subject `id`](spec.md#subjectid) of the CDEvent.
__Note__: since the *subject* is mandatory in CDEvents, the `subject` in the CloudEvents format will always be set - even if it's not mandated by the CloudEvents specification.

### time

The [CloudEvents `time`][ce-time] MUST be set to the [`timestamp`](spec.md#timestamp) of the CDEvent. The CloudEvents specification allows for `time` to be set to either the current time or the time of the occurrence, but it requires all producers to be chose the same option. CDEvents requires all producers to use the `timestamp` from the CDEvent to meet the CloudEvents specification.

### datacontenttype

The [CloudEvents `datacontenttype`][ce-contenttype] is optional, its use depends on the specific CloudEvents binding and mode in use. See the [event data](#cloudevents-data) section for more details.

### dataschema

The [CloudEvents `dataschema`][ce-dataschema] is MAY be set to a URL that points to the event data schema included in this specification.

## CloudEvents Data

The content and format of the event data depends on the specific CloudEvents binding in use. All the examples, unless otherwise stated, refer to the[HTTP binding][ce-http-binding] in [binary content mode][ce-binary]. In this format, the CloudEvents context is stored in HTTP headers.

The [CloudEvents Event Data][ce-eventdata] MUST include the full CDEvents, i.e.
[`context`](spec.md#cdevents-context), [`subject`](spec.md#cdevents-subject)
and any [custom data](spec.md#cdevents-custom-data), rendered as JSON in the
format specified by the [schema](./schemas/) for the event type.

[Custom data](spec.md#cdevents-custom-data) of type "application/json" MUST be
embedded as is in the [`customData`](spec.md#customdata) field. Data with any other
content-type MUST be base64 encoded and set as value for the
[`customData`](spec.md#customdata) field.

In CloudEvents HTTP binary mode, the `Content-Type` HTTP header MUST be set to `application/json`. In CloudEvents HTTP structured mode, the same information is carried in the CloudEvents context field `datacontenttype`.

### Examples

Full example of a CDEvents transported through a CloudEvent in HTTP *binary* mode:
