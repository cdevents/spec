# ![CDEvents](cdevents_horizontal-color.png)

CDEvents is a common specification for Continuous Delivery events, enabling
interoperability in the complete software production ecosystem.

It's an incubated project at the
[Continuous Delivery Foundation](https://cd.foundation) (CDF).

In a complex and fast moving CI/CD world with a lot of different tools and
platforms that need to communicate with each other interoperability stands as a
crucial thing. The maintainer of a CI/CD system needs to swap out tools in short
time with little to no stops.

The larger and more complex a CI/CD system becomes, challenges increase in
knowing how the tools communicate and what they do.

### What we provide

The CDEvents protocol defines a vocabulary of events enabling tools to
communicate in an interoperable way.

We extend other efforts such as CloudEvents by introducing purpose and semantics
to the event.

By providing an interoperable way of tools to communicate we also provide means
to give an overview picture increasing observability, but also to give measuring
points for metrics.

## CDEvents Specification

The latest release of the specification on is
[v0.4.0](https://github.com/cdevents/spec/blob/v0.4.0/spec.md), and you can
continuously follow the latest updates of the specification on [the `main`
branch](./spec.md).

To understand more about the concepts and ideas that have formed the current published
specification, visit the [CDEvents Documentation](https://cdevents.dev/docs/) site.

The reference specification is maintained in this repository.

Key assets are as follows:

### [White Paper](./CDEvents_Whitepaper.pdf)

The Continuous Delivery Foundation White Paper on CDEvents

### [Primer](https://cdevents.dev/docs/primer/)

An introduction to CDEvents and associated concepts

### [Common Metadata](./spec.md)

An overview of Metadata common across the CDEvents Specification

### [Core Events](./core.md)

Definition of specific events that are fundamental to pipeline execution and orchestration

### [Source Code Control Events](./source-code-version-control.md)

Handling Events relating to changes in version management of Source Code and related assets

### [Continuous Integration Events](./continuous-integration.md)

Handling Events associated with Continuous Integration activities, typically involving build and test

### [Continuous Deployment Events](./continuous-deployment.md)

Handling Events associated with Continuous Deployment activities

### [Continuous Operations Events](./continuous-operations.md)

Handling Events associated with the health of the services deployed and running in a specific environment

### [Testing Events](./testing-events.md)

Handling Events associated with Test execution performed independently or as part of CI/CD pipelines.

### [CloudEvents Binding and Transport](./cloudevents-binding.md)

Defining how CDEvents are mapped to CloudEvents for transportation and delivery

### [Schemas](./schemas/) and [Conformance](./conformance/)

The [schemas](./schemas/) folder contains `jsonschemas` for all events in the spec. The [conformance](./conformance/) folder contains simple `JSON` examples for all events. The content of the conformance folder is used for testing purposes: the structure of the files in there is sound, the values have correct types but are not particularly meaningful.

## CDEvents SDKs

CDEvents includes SDKs for several languages:

* [Go](https://github.com/cdevents/sdk-go)
* [Java](https://github.com/cdevents/sdk-java)
* [Python](https://github.com/cdevents/sdk-python)
